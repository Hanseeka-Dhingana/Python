## What is the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important first step in data science projects. It involves understanding the data sets by summarizing their main characteristics often plotting them visually. This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning.   
Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data.

## Why Exploratory Data Analysis is important?  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is important for several reasons, especially in the context of data science and statistical modeling.   


-   Helps to understand the dataset, showing how many features there are, the type of data in each feature, and how the data is spread out, which helps in choosing the right methods for analysis.     
- EDA helps to identify hidden patterns and relationships between different data points, which help us in and model building.
Allows to spot errors or unusual data points (outliers) that could affect your results.      
- Insights that you obtain from EDA help you decide which features are most important for building models and how to prepare them to improve performance.   
- By understanding the data, EDA helps us in choosing the best modeling techniques and adjusting them for better results.

## Steps for Performing Exploratory Data Analysis
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves a series of steps designed to help you understand the data youâ€™re working with, uncover underlying patterns, identify anomalies, test hypotheses, and ensure the data is clean and suitable for further analysis.
