# Tyes of Exploratory Data Analysis

There are three types of Exploratory Data Analysi.   
1) Univariate Analysis
2) Bivariate Analysis
3) Multivariate Analysis

## **1) Univariate Data**   

Univariate Data involves the measurement or observation of a single characteristic or attribute for each individual or item in the dataset. Analyzing univariate data is the simplest form of analysis in statistics.   

***`Key points in Univariate analysis:`***

- **No Relationships:** It does not explore relationships between variables or attempt to identify causes.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Descriptive statistics, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, standard deviation), are commonly used in the analysis of univariate data.
- **Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, and other graphical representations are often used to visually represent the distribution of the single variable.

**Example**: Sales distribution, Age spread.

## **2) Bivariate Data**

Bivariate data involves two different variables, and the analysis of this type of data focuses on understanding the relationship or association between these two variables.

***`Key points in Bivariate analysis:`***  

- **Relationship Analysis:** The primary goal of analyzing bivariate data is to understand the relationship between the two variables. This relationship could be positive (both variables increase together), negative (one variable increases while the other decreases), or show no clear pattern.
- **Scatterplots:** A common visualization tool for bivariate data is a scatterplot, where each data point represents a pair of values for the two variables. Scatterplots help visualize patterns and trends in the data.
- **Correlation Coefficient:** A quantitative measure called the correlation coefficient is often used to quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1.

**Example**: Checking the correlation between temperature and electricity consumption.

## **3) Multivariate Data**   

Multivariate data refers to datasets where each observation or sample point consists of multiple variables or features. These variables can represent different aspects, characteristics, or measurements related to the observed phenomenon. When dealing with three or more variables, the data is specifically categorized as multivariate.

**`1️ Analysis Techniques (How We Analyze the Data)`**  
Different methods can be used depending on what we want to achieve. Some common techniques include:

- **Regression Analysis →** Used to predict one variable based on others. Example: Predicting house prices based on size, location, and number of rooms.  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) →** Reduces many variables into a few important ones to simplify the data.
- **Path Analysis →** Examines how different variables influence each other in a step-by-step process.
- **Factor Analysis →** Groups related variables together to identify hidden patterns.
- **MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) →** Compares differences in multiple variables across different groups.   
  
**`2️⃣ Goals of Analysis (Why We Do It)`**    
The method we choose depends on what we want to find out. Some common goals include:

- **Prediction →** Using some variables to predict another (e.g., predicting a student’s grade based on study hours and attendance).  
- **Finding Patterns →** Identifying hidden connections between variables (e.g., understanding how customer preferences are linked to their age and income).     
- **Comparing Groups →** Checking how different groups behave across multiple variables (e.g., comparing customer satisfaction scores from different cities).     
  
**`3️⃣ Interpretation (Understanding the Results)`**   
Multivariate analysis gives us a **deeper insight** into data. It helps us:

- See how different variables interact with each other.
- Find patterns that may not be obvious when looking at just one variable at a time.
- Make better decisions based on a more complete understanding of the data.
